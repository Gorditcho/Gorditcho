- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gorditcho
- 👀 I’m interested in ancient caves, eastern Australian geology and learning to run legacy Macs on current OS's and systems and do it so well I can help others
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Opencore and patching and keeping old but good Macs alive
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above
- 📫 How to reach me gordonpmills@gmail.com
